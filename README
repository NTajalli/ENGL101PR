This is the repository for the source code of my freshman year 1st semester public remediation project for English 101. My topic of issue was Automation and AI, specifically the ethical implications of it. My position paper discusses many of the ethical questions that are being presented and also the potential impacts on society's moral ability AI may have. I discuss heavily moral deskilling, worker displacement, and the many shifts of responsability. This project serves as a website that is meant to provide resources, such as papers and articles, for those interested in the topic to view. I also provided a download link to an infographic that can be spread with a QR code linking back to the site.
