          </h1>
          <p>            We often associate the source of debate when it comes to automation with worker displacement and for good reason. Jack Kelly discusses how the number 
          of jobs lost to automation by 2030 in the US could reach upwards of 73 million when discussing the impact of automation on the U.S. job market. To put 
          that in perspective, the population of the U.S. is currently around 330 million, meaning it is likely automation could consume over 1 in 5 people’s current jobs.
           Many view automation as machines undergoing the tasks that humans find tedious and repetitive. Dating back to the industrial revolution, automation has significantly 
           greatened economic production while reducing the human cost. However, these all come with consequences. As mentioned, automation works by taking jobs to increase
            production, and with the development of artificial intelligence (AI), the rate of job loss is only going to increase. Additionally, the evolution automation is 
            currently undergoing may present unprecedented consequences that will likely be needing attention, thus prompting various debates on not only whether automation 
            is ethical, but whether the newer waves of automation will change individual as well as collective ethical and moral behavior in society.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such debates, in short, stem from the following questions. For one, is the worker displacement caused by automation and AI material enough to question the ethics 
            of automation? Secondly, is convenience enough of a justification to take responsibility away from humans and give it to machines even though this might affect individual 
            kill development? Lastly, will simple tasks and decisions being completed by machines result in the moral deskilling of humanity or, in other words, the loss of the 
            development of our moral character? This paper will serve not so far as to provide concrete answers to these questions, but to discuss the imminence and significance 
            of these problems, as well as provide ways to avoid these problems. These questions boil down to how automation and AI store consequences that raise questions about how 
            ethical the effects are, and how AI and automation’s possible future control over many human responsibilities will affect humanity’s ethical development both individually 
            and collectively. These problems can be avoided/minimized if society’s implementation of future automation emphasizes human morality and provides amenities that reduce the 
            effects of worker displacement.

          </p>
        <p>Historically, automation’s main debate has been related to worker displacement. Every year, millions of jobs are taken by machines, and this has been a trend for around a 
          century now. Business owners have found that machines do jobs better and faster and do not need to be paid. The impact on society has historically been positive since 
          automation has been a necessity when meeting the growing demands of the modern economy. However, this comes at the expense of workers, particularly those in lower-skilled 
          labor jobs. These workers have been replaced by machines and in recent years, many have found that the supply for lower-skilled jobs is decreasing rapidly while the demand 
          for these jobs still looms large even though historically, “society has always managed to absorb displaced workers, at least over the long-term” (Heinrich and Witko). 
          Another issue sited by Heinrich and Witko is how some studies have indicated that a much wider range of jobs are at risk of being automated, with the number being as high 
          as half of all U.S. jobs, begging the question: will society be able to keep up with the influx of workers being displaced and will other jobs be enough to accommodate the 
          surplus of workers who have been displaced?
        </p>
        <p>The problem of worker displacement has been a problem for generations, but it has not gotten to the point of an unemployment crisis, or anything even close really. Jobs 
          from other sectors have generally been responsible for taking in displaced workers. The current fear is that as automation is implemented more, there won’t be enough jobs 
          in other sectors for displaced workers to turn to. As of today, that fear has not become reality, and it is still far from reality. But what if this reality does happen in 
          the near future? The most obvious, and probably best solution, is to retrain and re-skill workers. This would require a quick work force change, which, as explained by 
          McKinsey Global Institute, has never been seen before. Older workforce transformations have occurred over many decades, so changing this fast would require a lot of energy 
          and focus by society as a whole. Additionally, it would require a change in our education system, mainly making higher education more available that way more people have the
          resources to acquire the required skills in our job market. This job market transformation would have other benefits too; more people will be educated and there will be less 
          of a discrepancy between lower-class workers and higher-class workers. Even if the current market will not be able to take in future displaced workers, there are ways to make 
          ure these workers are accommodated for.</p>
          <p>Now that we have discussed the economic consequences of automation and how to address them, we can get into the ethical implications of automation. Automation stems 
            farther than just displacing workers; it affects everyone to at least some degree. We already see tiny robots that hover around the house vacuuming for us, and we have 
            tools like alexa that can go as far as controlling our homes’ electrical system. These can all be great things, but what happens when AI reaches the point where robots 
            are capable of making decisions? And no, I am not talking about a terminator-like scenario, but rather a more obscure scenario where machines undertake previously human 
            responsibilities. The problem with this is whether it is ethical to take away human responsibility and give it to machines. How big of a scale of decisions will we allow 
            machines to undertake? Will we, at some point, elect a machine with elite decision-making capabilities as president? In all seriousness, these are questions we must 
            consider. At what point do we draw the line and say, “hey, this is something that only a human should do?”. </p>
            <p>This is a question that is incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to answer. However, one thing we need to examine is whether machines will truly ever reach the point 
              of making decisions a human can make. As a student in computer science, I have learned that our current knowledge of AI is not anywhere close to that point. In fact, it is 
              likely that machines will never be able to reach the point of large-scale autonomous decision making. Machine learning algorithms can be incredibly sophisticated, but how 
              exactly can someone program a robot to make a moral decision when most of the decisions we make are so subjective and not entirely data-driven, which is how machine learning 
              lgorithms operate? At some point, however, automation will reach some decision-making capacity, but when this time comes, we can ensure that automation is deployed and 
              implemented in ways that produce more and better jobs for humans and drive economic growth while also promoting societal well-being. How exactly can we create more jobs with 
              automation? Well, one consequence of advancing technology is the introduction of new job sectors and career fields. Additionally, as explained by Sven Nyholm in his paper, 
              humans will always be needed to initiate, supervise, and manage these machines and different systems. 
</p> <p>
  Another consequence of taking responsibility away from humans and handing it over to machines is the concept of moral deskilling. Brian Patrick Green describes moral deskilling as 
  the collective loss of making moral decisions because of a lack of experience and development. When humans are deprived of responsibility, we lose, or fail to gain, vital skills 
  that influence our personalities and future decisions. If we hand over all our responsibilities to machines, we, as humans, are left without a purpose. Not only that, but what moral
  sis will society stand on if there is no one left to uphold the morals? Who in society will have the ability to discern right from wrong, or be able to judge a complex situation?
   How will we know to resist evil temptations when we either do not know what evil is or know the consequences of evil? It all boils down to whether AI has the potential to 
   infantilize us, and if it does, how do we prevent it from doing so? The answer starts with how assertively and strictly we, as a society, play our role in dictating the future 
   of automation and AI deployment.  

</p>
<p>When discussing automation and AI, I feel like it is important to understand that society is in complete control of how we implement AI. We are the creators after all, and we need 
  to strive to incorporate automation and AI in a manner that works for us. What exactly does work for us though? We can think about this question in a philosophical manner. The idea 
   am presenting stems from Pak-Hang Wong’s confucian driven response, where he explains how our implementation of future AI and automation should conform to certain confucian ideals.
   he ideals are intended to prevent the replacement of humans in vital situations that build moral character, and rather complement humans to help increase efficiency and convenience
   without sacrificing what is important to humanity’s development. This can be implemented by mandating machines to follow rules that state that they can only act in ways that will 
   improve human moral development, and cannot act in ways that would be immoral or bring out evil qualities (Wong). It follows the confucian paradigm, which, in short, explains how 
   ur humanism is achieved through experience, collaboration, and action. All this sounds easier than it really is. After all, how can we expect greedy businesses to adhere to certain
   orals when it comes at the expense of profits? While we certainly cannot expect that, we can urge governments to provide more oversight on how automation and AI are implemented. 
   At some point, I believe there will be some sort of agency in charge of setting guidelines for automation that corporations must follow. Sooner or later, society will figure out 
   that we cannot afford to let automation take over without restriction. There is light at the end of the tunnel, however; many politicians have begun to shift focus to some of the 
   problems AI and automation are starting to present. For example, Andrew Yang, presidential candidate for the 2020 election as well as 2021 NYC mayor candidate, has based much of 
   his running platform on automation and the threats that it presents to the job market. Although he was never elected, he has brought substantial attention to these issues. </p>
   <p>All these problems automation and AI are bringing can seem overwhelming at first glance. However, hopefully you have recognized a theme among the individual solutions I have 
     presented to each of these problems: each solution appears to be based on how we implement automation. It comes down to killing multiple birds with one stone. The main barrier 
     is inducing corporations and governments to recognize that these are issues that require attention and action. Just because the consequences are not full-blown yet does not mean
     hey are not imminent and lurking in the shadows. However, we have seen that companies are starting to prioritize retraining employees to overcome the employment hurdles that AI 
     is presenting. According to McKinsey, “Sixty-two percent of executives believe they will need to retrain or replace more than a quarter of their workforce between now and 2023 
     due to advancing automation and digitization”. That number will only grow in the future and these numbers act as signs that we are starting to correctly adapt to the unprecedented
     hanges AI and modern-day automation are bringing. Additionally, as I mentioned before, politicians are starting to recognize and bring attention to these issues, providing us 
     with great optimism that we are more than capable of adapting and avoiding the potential adverse effects of rapidly evolving technology. 
  </p>
  <p>Those with a pessimistic view of automation and AI often reason that moral deskilling and unemployment crisis are inevitable because humanity will always choose the convenient 
    path forward, no matter the expense. In the case of automation, corporations will always implement AI and automate whatever possible to maximize productivity and save money. 
    Holders of this particular view often cite climate change as a comparable issue saying the problems presented by AI and automation will be treated similarly to climate change, 
    where many companies and governments do little to address the issue, or rather deny the validity of it all together. However, people with this viewpoint fail to realize that 
    climate change is an issue that is being increasingly addressed every year, although not at the rate it requires. These two issues are completely different in that the main cause 
    f the dispute is the cause of the consequences. When it comes to automation, the consequences will indisputably be tied to AI since worker displacement will be easily linked to 
    AI and unemployment. Additionally, we are already seeing companies and governments address automation, which indicates the situation is being handled differently than climate 
    change and that society is starting to prioritize avoiding the dire consequences.</p>
    <p>I remember my first machine learning task. I was helping out at my father’s cybersecurity company and I was tasked with helping out a team of talented and experienced software 
      engineers implement a controller that enhances the efficiency and accuracy of the company’s software. The anti-malware the company made was great, and at this point, the best way 
      o improve it was to figure out a way for the software to learn from past data. With every new detected threat, whether it be real or a false alarm, the team’s newly developed AI 
      improved the anti-malware and made it better and faster at every single operation it underwent, all just by learning from the past. Just like a human, the software learned from 
      past experience. I did not contribute a whole lot as I was just a newbie when it came to software engineering let alone AI/machine learning, but the whole operation was truly 
      eye-opening. Seeing software utilized in such a way opens up new doors for problem-solvers to attack new problems. However, as discussed, while new doors open up for solutions, 
      new doors also open up for problems. The potential AI has to improve our society is genuinely incredible. If we implement automation and AI in such a way that does not conflict 
      with our current humanistic world and rather complements it, then the possibilities of what civilizations may become are unfathomable. Not only the problems automation and AI 
      present but also the solutions are the reasons why everyone, especially those in power, needs to direct more attention to it.</p>
      <p>Worker displacement, unemployment crisis, moral deskilling, literal dehumanization and infantilization: these are all extremely frightening situations. Understandably, many 
        are worried for the future as a result of AI and automation, and rightfully so. It is important, however, to consider the possibilities and prioritize addressing these 
        problems rather than completely shutting down ideas with such great potential. Worker displacement is inevitable, but not to the point of an unemployment crisis. Companies 
        have already started to provide generous amenities to employees that have been laid off and supplying resources to find a new job or rather develop more skills for a new job. 
        oral deskilling needs to be looked at as a choice. We have the choice whether or not to allow robots to make vital decisions for us. We have the choice to take the required 
        amount of responsibility to develop a moral compass. As more time passes and more attention is devoted to these issues, the potential for these consequences will likely dwindle 
        away or at the very least be minimized, and with that, society can reap the benefits of AI and automation, which will play a significant role in combating many other of the 
        problems plaguing society.</p>
